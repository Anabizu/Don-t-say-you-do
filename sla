Sweet talk, so sweet that I'm getting a toothache
Too good to be good, shouldn't eat it
You talk like you need me, like you'd never leave me
Until I begin to believe it
I was good on my own until you came along
Waited for me to fall
Now you're gone, baby, gone
If you don't mean it, don't just say it
If you don't feel it, don't you fake it
If it's a lie, baby, don't say it's true
If you don't want it, why'd you take it?
How come you bought it, just to break it?
If you don't love me, then don't say
Don't say you do
Days passed since I'd seen a trace of your face
A million things caught your attention
I begged, "Just be honest", you said that you promise
My disbelief lost its suspension
I was good on my own until you came along
Waited for me to fall
Now you're gone, baby, gone
If you don't mean it, don't just say it
If you don't feel it, don't you fake it
If it's a lie, baby, don't say it's true
If you don't want it, why'd you take it?
How come you bought it, just to break it?
If you don't love me, then don't say
Don't say you do
Got your name, and your fame, and the beautiful people
I guess I can't say I'm surprised
But who's gonna love you when all that you've got
Is your name, and your fame, and your lies?
And your lies
If you don't mean it, don't just say it
If you don't feel it, don't you fake it
If it's a lie, baby, don't say it's true
If you don't want it, why'd you take it?
How come you bought it, just to break it?
If you don't love me, then don't say
Don't say you do
